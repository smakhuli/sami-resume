## About This Website

The purpose of this responsive website is to serve as a replacement for the traditional resume. I built this website from scratch using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery plugins. I had originally planned to build this website using WordPress, but decided to develop it from scratch to showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery. I used media queries to make the website responsive for the following categories of device/browser sizes:

- 0 to 480 pixels
- 481 to 767 pixels
- 768 to 1023 pixels
- 1124 to 1200 pixels

I tested this website with Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE browsers. I used the <a href="https://validator.w3.org" target="_blank">https://validator.w3.org</a> website to validate my HTML and it passed with zero errors or warnings. I used animate.css to add some animation to the header section of the website. I used the JQuery waypoint plugin to help suppport sticky navigation, smooth scrolling and mobile navigation.
