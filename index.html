                    <p>
                        Since February 2014, in addition to my full time job as an RoR senior web developer, I started doing part-time RoR web development on a contract basis for 4 different clients to supplement my income. As of August 1st,  2018, I have moved into a full-time contractor role.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As an RoR web developer, I have also worked with HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL. I have worked with both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases and have used RSpec to build model and feature tests for the RoR applications I support. All RoR projects I work use Github as the repository and I am very familiar with Git. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have also done very limited PHP work for one of my clients, learning both the language and the web application while completing the required tasks. I also have experience with React.js, Node.js and Angular.js.

                         I worked as a contract programmer for Dixie Tool Distributors, Inc. (a local company in West Columbia, South Carolina) doing any needed programming (COBOL and BASIC).  I worked with another vendor to successfully migrate their VAX 3600 system to a new PC-based platform using a VAX-emulation software package. I upgraded their communication program to use a new protocol for electronically placing orders with vendors of automobile parts. I had two weeks to complete the project, and was able to get it done in a week without having any previous knowledge of their system. I was responsible for general maintenance of their existing system and documented portions of their system.  I also developed new functionality to allow Dixie Tool to sell Kits (a group of automobile parts) instead of only individual auto parts.

                         I started as Programmer Trainee and was promoted to a Lead Programmer Analyst position during this time. I worked on a PC-based system designed for Personal and Commercial Lines Independent Insurance Agents to allow them to do comparative rating for multiple Insurance Companies. I worked with Basic and COBOL to develop the Input screens (Basic), Rating (COBOL), and Output screens (Basic) and learned Basic on the job during this time.

            <h2>About This Website</h2>

            <p>
                I designed and built this responsive website from scratch using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and JQuery plugins. I had originally planned to build this website using WordPress, but decided to develop it from scratch to showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript/JQuery. It uses media queries to make the website responsive for the following category of device/browser sizes:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>0 to 480 pixels</li>
                <li>481 to 767 pixels</li>
                <li>768 to 1023 pixels</li>
                <li>1124 to 1200 pixels</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                All code for this website is avaialable for review on GitHub in a public repository. You can access the repository by clicking <a href="https://github.com/smakhuli/sami-resume" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The purpose of this website is to serve as a replacement for the traditional resume. You can access a more traditional resume by clicking <a href="https://frozen-scrubland-53577.herokuapp.com/users/1/show_resume" target="_blank">here</a>. This link will take you to a resume that is generated by a Ruby on Rails resume builder application I also developed from scratch. You can access the GitHub public repoistory for the Ruby on Rails web application by clicking <a href="https://github.com/smakhuli/resume" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
        
            <p class="">
                I tested this website with the Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers. I used the <a href="https://validator.w3.org" target="_blank">https://validator.w3.org</a> webiste to validate my HTML and it passed with zero errors or warnings. I used animate.css to add some animation to the header section of the website. I used the JQuery waypoint plugin to help suppport sticky navigation, smooth scrolling and mobile navigation.
