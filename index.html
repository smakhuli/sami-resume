                I have been in the software development business since 1985. I have 16 years of software development experience, 7 years of technical supervisory experience and 11 years of management experience.

            <p>
                I have been doing Ruby on Rails (RoR) web development for the past 7 years. During this time, I have become very proficient in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and SQL (primarily working with Postgresql databases). I have also worked with jQuery and have had limited exposure to Vue.js and React.js. I have worked on and managed projects using either agile or waterfall project management methodologies.

        <section class="section-about-website">
            <a class="anchor" id="about-website"></a>

            <h2>About This Website</h2>

            <p>
                I built this responsive website from scratch using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery plugins. I had originally planned to build this website using WordPress, but decided to develop it from scratch to showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery. I used media queries to make the website responsive for the following categories of device/browser sizes:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>0 to 480 pixels</li>
                <li>481 to 767 pixels</li>
                <li>768 to 1023 pixels</li>
                <li>1124 to 1200 pixels</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                All code for this website is avaialable for review on GitHub in a public repository. You can access the repository by clicking <a href="https://github.com/smakhuli/sami-resume" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                I tested this website with Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE browsers. I used the <a href="https://validator.w3.org" target="_blank">https://validator.w3.org</a> website to validate my HTML and it passed with zero errors or warnings. I used animate.css to add some animation to the header section of the website. I used the JQuery waypoint plugin to help suppport sticky navigation, smooth scrolling and mobile navigation.
            </p>

            <p>
                The purpose of this website is to serve as a replacement for the traditional resume. You can access a more traditional resume by clicking <a href="https://frozen-scrubland-53577.herokuapp.com/users/1/show_resume" target="_blank">here</a>. This link will take you to a resume that is generated by a Ruby on Rails resume builder application I also developed from scratch. You can access the GitHub public repository for the Ruby on Rails web application by clicking <a href="https://github.com/smakhuli/resume" target="_blank">here</a>. This web application is still a work in progress and I have not yet added the styling to make it responsive. It did receive an A in maintainability from Code Climate.
